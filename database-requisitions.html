<h2 id="database-requisitions">Database requisitions</h2>
<p>When deciding on what type of data store to select for a software system, vendor project, program, event e.g a PVT database for an election, the following guide is the criteria by which ICT recommends.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>There are two types of datastores supported at NDI. SQL or relational databases and NoSQL or Non-relational database. Relational databases are structured, like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses. e.g. MSSQL or MySQL. </p>
<p>Non-relational databases are document-oriented and distributed, like file folders that hold everything from a person’s address and phone number to their Facebook likes and online shopping preferences. e.g. Firebase Cloud Firestore, MongoDB.</p>
<h3 id="when-a-system-warrants-a-relational-database">When a system warrants a relational database</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Hierarchical data. By its nature, hierarchical data is relational. That is &quot;data that owns other data&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could represent an entire hierarchy as documents in a Non-relational database, but the ongoing management of that will be considerably more difficult than in a relational database, and will be up to your application layer to maintain. That’s a lot of non-trivial code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Permissions/permission groups/LDAP or ADFS type of systems permissions warrant a relational database.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The NDI organizational &quot;rollup&quot; structure, where employees roll up to managers who roll up to directors, etc warrants a relational database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relationships between data. This is somewhat related to hierarchical data, but instead of ownership, you need peer relationships. Think of a social network as an example.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could reference other documents’ _id’s to form relationships but as with hierarchical data, requires having a very complex application layer to enforce these relationships that are inherently baked into relational or graph databases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-a-system-warrants-a-non-relational-database">When a system warrants a non-relational database</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You are collecting pieces of information that may vary from user-to-user. For example, conditional responses in a form or survey.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may need to collect additional pieces of information in the future quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to persist a running log file to be queryable quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tradeoffs when using a non-relational or NoSQL database:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No built-in ACID compliance <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/multi-document-transactions-in-mongodb">up until recently</a>, e.g. a transaction that involves the modification of several document collections as one atomic unit</p>
</li>
<li><p>No concept of relational integrity between collections, e.g. if you rely on a collection’s _id on another collection’s document and you outright delete the parent document, there’s no cascading updates to update/delete/mark the child as null</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re familiar with any variant of SQL, the querying language will seem alien to you initially.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re familiar with JavaScript, the querying language will seem natural to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
